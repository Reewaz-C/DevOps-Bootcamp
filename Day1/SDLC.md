# **SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE**

Software Developemnt Life cycle or SDLC is a process which are used bt the dev teams to plan, design, build, and test quality software. It is basically a framework that gives a systematic approach to the development of the software development which ensures efficiency, quality and client requirements and needs. There are majorly two models which is used i.e. the waterfall model and Agile methodology.

## Waterfall Methodology

Waterfall Methodoly is a SDLC model where the software development approach is in linear, sequential order where when one phase is fully completed before starting on the next one.

### Phases of Waterfall Methodology:

1. Requirement gathering: Where the dev team collects and analysis the whole system requirements from the clients.

2. System Design: The team works on designing architectures, documentation of the designs, wireframes.

3. Implementation: The dev team writes the code according to the documentation of design.

4. Testing: The team tests the developed software and fixs all the known bugets.

5. Deployment: The final software is releases to the clients.

6. Maintainance: The bugs are patched, updating features, etc.

### Pros:

1. Simple and easy to unserstand the workflow.
2. well-defined stright forward stages.

### Cons:

1. It is non flexible and difficult to adapt to changes.
2. Testing is only done in late development stage.
