# DORA

## What is DORA?

    DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics is a set of four key metrics used to evaluate software delivery performance. These metrics help teams measure their speed and stability by tracking deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and mean time to restore.

## What is DORA metrics?

DORA metrics for DevOps teams focus on four critical measures:

1. Frequency of Deployments

    Deployment frequency is the average number of daily code deployments to prod environment. This is an indicator of overall efficiency od DevOps team, as it measures the speed of the development team and their capabilities and level of automation.

2. Lead Time for Changes

    Lead time for changes measures the average speed at which the DevOps team delivers code from commitment to deployment. It indicates the teams capacity and overall ability to respond to changes in the environment.

3. Change Failure Rate

    Change failure rate is the percentage of deployments that cause a failure in production. This metric can be challenging to measure because many deployments, especially critical response deployments, can generate bugs in production.

4. Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)

    Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) in DORA DevOps is a key metric that measures the average time it takes to restore service after a production failure.
