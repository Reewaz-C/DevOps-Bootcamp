# DORA

## What is DORA?

DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics is a set of four key metrics used to evaluate software delivery performance. These metrics help teams measure their speed and stability by tracking deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and mean time to restore.

## What is DORA metrics?

DORA metrics for DevOps teams focus on four critical measures:

1. Frequency of Deployments

    Deployment frequency is the average number of daily code deployments to prod environment. This is an indicator of overall efficiency od DevOps team, as it measures the speed of the development team and their capabilities and level of automation.

2. Lead Time for Changes

    Lead time for changes measures the average speed at which the DevOps team delivers code from commitment to deployment. It indicates the teams capacity and overall ability to respond to changes in the environment.

3. Change Failure Rate

    Change failure rate is the percentage of deployments that cause a failure in production. This metric can be challenging to measure because many deployments, especially critical response deployments, can generate bugs in production.

4. Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)

    Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) in DORA DevOps is a key metric that measures the average time it takes to restore service after a production failure.

## Benefits of DORA Metrices

1. Operational Visibility

    One of the primary advantages of DORA metrics is the improved visibility they provide into the software delivery process.Metrics such as Deployment Frequency and Change Failure Rate enable teams to track and refine their deployment procedures, resulting in more efficient software releases.

2. Continious Improvements

    DORA metrics play a crucial role in pinpointing performance bottlenecks and opportunities for enhancement. By consistently tracking these metrics, teams can embrace a mindset of continuous improvement, progressively refining their delivery capabilities.

3. Promoting culture of excellance

    DORA metrics can foster a culture of excellence and accountability among software development teams by emphasizing essential performance indicators. They motivate teams to aim for improved performance, resulting in superior software products.

## Challanges of DORA Metrices

1. Measurement Challenges
    
    Implementing and accurately measuring DORA metrics can be significant, especially in complex, multi-team environments.

2. Narrow Focus

    Focusing primarily on operational metrics DORA may cause organizations to overlook other essential factors like innovation, creativity, and long-term strategic planning. This limited perspective can foster a workplace culture that emphasizes metrics at the expense of significant progress, which could hinder creativity and innovation.

3. Incomplete Picture

    DORA metrics fail to consider elements such as market trends, customer feedback, or the overall user experience, all of which are crucial for a thorough understanding of a project's success.
