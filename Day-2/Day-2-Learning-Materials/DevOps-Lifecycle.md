# DEVOPS LIFECYCLE

DevOps lifecycle is a set of stages that software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams use to deliver software applications in an efficient and reliable manner. The primary goal of the DevOps lifecycle is to streamline the development and delivery process and ensure applications are reliable and efficiently deployed.

## Key Phases of DevOps Lifecycle

The DevOps lifecycle includes seven main phases.

1. Plan

Planning is the starting point of the lifecycle. It is where we scope the features, evaluate implementation strategies, and ensure all stakeholders agree on requiremnts.

2. Code

The code or development part is where developers write the code to implement planned changes in the project.

3. Test

Once the code is written it needs to be tested and the dev team or test team write various test cases to ensure the code work properly and security is maintained.

4. Build

After the code has been tested we need to create the artifacts that will be use for release. This is where we compile code, build Docker container images and prepare artifacts that will be needed in production.

5.Release

The release phase occurs when the code has been verified as ready for deployment and a last check for production readiness has been performed.

6. Deploy

Deployment is when the changes actually ship to users or clients. In the deploy phase, the project is prepared for the production environment and is operating as planned in that environment.

7. Monitoring

In the monitoring phase user feedback, issues, or possibilities for improvement are identified and documented for improvements. This phase is essential for planning the next iteration.
